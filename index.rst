This document describes the operational concepts for the emerging LSST DPP group which will operate
the system that will be delivered by the LSST construction project. This system will be incrementally
stood up and operated by the construction project as part of validation and verification activities
within the construction project.

The concept of operations covers approximately 40 distinct services, The operations concepts
are initially developed in Google docs. It is the vision to  migrate these documents to
ReStructuredText as they mature.  Therefore, initially, we will provide pointers to documents as
the level of drafting within the working group becomes suitable to expose the documents to the
LSST construction project.
